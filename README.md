# dataModel.Parking
These data models are intended to model entities relevant for parking use cases in smart cities scenarios. When feasible these models reuse types, properties and enumerations from [DATEX II version 2.3](http://www.datex2.eu/content/parking-publications-extension-v10a). A data dictionary for DATEX II terms can be found at [http://datexbrowser.tamtamresearch.com/](http://datexbrowser.tamtamresearch.com/).
Nonetheless, these data models are intended to NGSI-based systems and many simplifications has been made with respect to DATEX II version 2.3.
