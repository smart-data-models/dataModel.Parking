# Parking Spot

## Description

A parking spot is an area well delimited where _one_ vehicle can be parked. The
aim of this entity type is to monitor the status of parking spots individually.
Thus, an entity of type `ParkingSpot` cannot exist without a containing entity
of type (`OnStreetParking`, `OffStreetParking`). A parking spot might belong to
_one_ group.

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).
