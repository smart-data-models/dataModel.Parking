Required properties  
- `id`  - `location`  - `type`    
A site, off street, intended to park vehicles, managed independently and with suitable and clearly marked access points (entrances and exits). If necessary, and for management purposes or to deal with multi-location parking sites, it can be divided into different zones modelled by the entity type [ParkingGroup](../ParkingGroup/README.md) . In DATEX 2 version 2.3 terminology it corresponds to a _UrbanParkingSite_ of type _offStreetParking_.
